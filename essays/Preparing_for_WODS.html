  <p>For my recent WODS for BrowserHistory6, SmartPhones1, and Invoices1, I noticed that I would struggle at certain points in the instructions. It was most noticable for SmartPhones1 since I ran into an issue where all the code for the assignment was pretty much done but a simple step of not closing my script tag properly led to the images, item names, and prices to not load at all. This was a bit frustrating since I thought I had followed all instructions properly but a simple typo or missing link led to a significant delay in completing the assignment.</p>

<p>A similar issue happened with the Invoices1 WOD since I did not add script tags to my document.write commands for each product. The errors or typos may be due to the pressure from setting a time limit, however, minor errors like this should not happen so frequently and should be caught while reviewing the code and checking the updates to the web page. I felt the most comfortable with BrowserHistory6 since it was not a significant change to the originial files and was mainly a continuation from BH1, 2 and 3. Also, I felt more engaged with the assignment since the idea of building a dynamic webpage with mouseover buttons with images seemed a bit exciting.</p>

<p>I also felt more prepared for Browser History 6. For example, I reviewed the screencasts, read through the instructions, and prepared an outline for what I would do once the timer started. In my previous WODS, I would simply start the timer and read through the instructions. I believe this contributed to the previously mentioned mistakes I would do due to the time pressure. If I used a similar strategy for SmartPhones1 and Invoices1, I may have felt more prepared and less stressed about making the DNF time for each exercise.</p>

<p>This will likely be my strategy for WODS going forward. I will need to read through the instructions and hints carefully and prepare a structured outline on how I will start the assignment. I also feel that using my notes from the screencasts in addition to the outline would help significantly. There were moments where I felt a bit stuck during the WODS and spent time searching through my notes. I could cut down on time spent referencing my notes if I were to create an outline that includes technical notes on how to solve each WOD.</p>
