  <p>For the Browserhistory1 WOD, it took me a few tries to be below the DNF time. The first attempt took about an hour for me to properly write the code to match the required format. I rewatched my screen recordings to see what was taking up a majority of my time. I noticed that after each update, I would save and refresh my webpage. Due to my inexperience in coding, I felt that I would need to constantly check the changes to catch a mistake early on. However, this added to my time significantly. It may have been due to my inexperience in coding. After a few attempts, I was able to make more changes and retrace steps to track where an error happened.</p>

<p>The WOD solutions also helped to cut down on my time significantly. Comparing my recordings to the solution, showed me how I was doing steps inefficiently. For example, while formatting the paragraphs for the body I copy and pasted each paragraph one by one, rather than pasting over the entire browser history summary. I initially tried to copy and paste the entire section but it looked messy &amp; difficult to manage. The solution showed me that there is an option to format large bodies of text with word wrap. This saved a lot of time since I would simply need to add the required HTML tags to each section &amp; copy and past the different headers and paragraphs into the set tags, similar to making a template to hold the content.</p>
