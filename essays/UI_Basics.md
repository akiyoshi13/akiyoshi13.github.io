For the Browserhistory1 WOD, it took me a few tries to be below the DNF time. The first attempt took about an hour for me to properly write the code to match the required format. I rewatched my screen recordings to see what was taking up a majority of my time. I noticed that after each update, I would save and refresh my webpage. Due to my inexperience in coding, I felt that I would need to constantly check the changes to catch a mistake early on. However, this added to my time significantly. It may have been due to my inexperience in coding. After a few attempts, I was able to make more changes and retrace steps to track where an error happened. 

The WOD solutions also helped to cut down on my time significantly. Comparing my recordings to the solution, showed me how I was doing steps inefficiently. For example, while formatting the paragraphs for the body I copy and pasted each paragraph one by one, rather than pasting over the entire browser history summary. I initially tried to copy and paste the entire section but it looked messy & difficult to manage. The solution showed me that there is an option to format large bodies of text with word wrap. This saved a lot of time since I would simply need to add the required HTML tags to each section & copy and past the different headers and paragraphs into the set tags, similar to making a template to hold the content.
