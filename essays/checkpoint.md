At my previous job at CoStar Group, the leadership emphasized lean processes, enterprise data, and data metrics. This led me to be interested in leaerning more and building skills in the Information Systems field. The experience taught me how important it is for an organization to have a healthy information management system. For example, the internal CRM system's data allowed us to identify trends and areas of improvement in the company's order to cash processes. 

I decided to enroll in the MSIS program due to my interest in data analysis and data architecture. I would also love to learn more about how small businesses here on Oahu can implement strategic information system projects to improve operations.
