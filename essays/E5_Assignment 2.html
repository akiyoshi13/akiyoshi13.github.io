  <p>A key takeaway from Assignment 2 was how to validate and store user data. Prior to the assignment, it was difficult for me to conceptualze how sites/web pages would store and access user data. By making the data persistent, it allows users to store info from previous sessions or purchases and the owner of the site can also use it to gain better insights from the user activity. It was also interesting to learn about how user info could be used to modify objects within the e-commerce store.</p>

<p>Another takeaway from this assignment was how difficult it can be to set up a webpage that has user registration data. Previously, I did not consider the complexity of the task. I would use sites &amp; apps daily that required login info, however, I did not consider what type of programming would be needed in order to make a daily process like that happen. While working on the assignment &amp; setting up the login info I ran into a few errors. The registration info would not store properly and once it did, the login could not validate registered acccount info. In order to solve this issue, I went to various coding forums like Stack Overlfow, CodeGuru, and Reddit to see if people ran into similar issues. Some of the responses helped greatly since it provided a variety of possible solutions and showed why the errors were happening.</p>

<p>I felt that this assignment was different than assignment #1 primarily through the fact that user data needed to be persistent and secure. All users needed to be able to access the app through the login, however, I had to find a way to keep the login info secure. The first assignment seemed to focus more on the client-facing side of the webpage where this assignment focused on the backend and in areas users might not think about. Also, a key difference was personalization on the invoice page. It was great to see how the user registration data would be used to update objects on the invoice &amp; login page to add a more personal user experience.</p>

<p>For the % of time spent on the assignment, I believe i spent about 20% thinking about how to do each step and outlining the coding, 40% writing code, and 40% testing and debugging. This was a bit different than my previous assignment since I would say that I spent less time preparing an outline and tried to go through the assignment step by step. Overall, I feel that using more time to prepare and thinking through how I would approach the assignment helped significantly throughout the process. However, I still feel that my writing code &amp; debugging and testing processes could be improved greatly.</p>

<p>For the writing, testing, and debugging phases, I found that dividing the assignment into modules or sub-parts helped improve my efficiency since I previously had the bad habit of writing long portions of code without testing it. This led to significant delays in trying to debug since it was difficult to identify what sections were causing the errors. If I could go back in time and do the assignment differently, I would increase the amount of time I spent thinking about how to approach the assignment. I would be able to come up with a more detailed outline and create a process map/visual to help while coding. With the outline or visual, I could take each segment, write the code, then test it piece by piece. I believe it would also help greatly in identifying where issues are coming from.</p>
