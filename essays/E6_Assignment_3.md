Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My system/site is a store selling electronics - cameras, TVs, and PCs. 

Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

Key features not implemented are a rating system and a search feature. In many e-commerce sites, the two are key features that users rely on and since mine are missing the two, it hurts the usability of the site. Also, it may be more difficult for users to navigate the different pages. 

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

I am most proud of the feature of allowing an inventory tracker and user logins. The two were areas that contributed most to the delays. The inventory tracker was previously not tracking properly and users were able to order more than the shown amounts. Also, for the user logins, I had issues with encrypting user passwors in the user.json file. If I was unable to fix this, it would be a significant security concern & it would put my users at risk for data breaches. However, the two were able to be added and the user passwords are now encrypted. 

Describe what you are least happy with your system:

I am the least happy with the layout or design of the website. I feel that it is missing key accessability and navigation features. For example, many ecommerce sites today have navigation tools that allow users to seamlessly browse stores. However, my site feels a bit clunky when compared to online retailers. 

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

A major difference in this assignment was creating the multiple pages for different products. At first, I thought it would be an easy step since it would be copies of my product pages from assignment 2. However, I had some difficulties with assigning the correct inventory amounts across the different products. Also, having the site store the user data or cookies for their activity was very different. I needed to implement cookies for user requests such as adding items to cart and storing that data between login sessions. 

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

A problem I ran in to was displaying cart items. The early stages of my cart were not pulling the correct quantities and storing the added items between logins. To address the issue, I did online research on Stack Overflow and made questions asking for ideas on why the errors were occuring. 

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

What worked well in this assignment was a strategy similar to assignment 2. I broke down the task into smaller, more manageable chunks and created a timeline of where each task needed to be completed. I  also took more time to research the concepts and technologies required for the assignment. This was through online research and video tutorials on areas were I had difficulties. 

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

Although it helped in some areas, online research and references was a bit counterproductive to the assignment. I found submitted solutions for my issues with the cart and cookies, however, it did not properly apply to the system as a whole or it was incompatible with the rest of my site. 

What did you learn from doing this assignment?

From this project, I learnt how to make an authentication system to restrict access to sensitive data. I also learnt how to apply encryption w to protect the userâ€™s data, and also input validation o ensure that only valid data is accepted.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

If I were to do things differently, I would try to work in a group rather than alone. It would have been benefical for us to work in parallel as effectively as possible. We could have created a list of task that needed to be completed and assigned them to each team member. Also, we could have brainstormed on a  timeline on when each task would need to be completed. 

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging


I would say 35% was spent thinking about how to do something. 35% was writing code and 30% was spent on testing and debugging. Compared to my Assignment 2, I spent more time writing code and debugging. The planning phase felt a bit shorter since I mostly modified my plan from assignment 2. The majority of the time was trying to write the code and resolving errors that arose.
